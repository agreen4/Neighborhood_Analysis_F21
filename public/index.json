We’ll also think through two foundational questions:","tags":null,"title":"Session 1: Course Introduction","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   With those basics in mind, you can start to explore the basic functionality of R.\nStarting Simple - Math and Basic Operators Now that you have a basic lay of the land for the RStudio console, we can start to explore some logic and functionality. Let’s start simple - with some basic math operators. Try doing some basic math by typing in the console window and hitting return / enter to execute:\n2+2 ## [1] 4 Note that you type in code, R executes it, and immediately below what you’ve typed in, it has returned an answer. Here are some of the most common mathematical operators which you’ll take advantage of:\n + Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication / Division ^ Exponent (e.g. 2^3 = 8) () parentheses (to enforce a desired order of operations - r automatically follows the typical order of operation rules)  There are also some built in mathematical constants:\npi ## [1] 3.141593 Which makes it really easy to figure out things, like the area of a circle with a radius of 5 (recall \\(A = \\pi r^2\\)):\npi*5^2 ## [1] 78.53982 While we won’t be doing much (if any) math this way, it’s important to become familiar with how this works, and what the expected response is from R.\n Assigning values to objects One of the useful things about R is that it is an object oriented programming language. This means that we can easily assign values to objects and then use those objects in calculations later on. We can assign values using the \u0026lt;- assignment operator.\nr \u0026lt;- 5 Hmm - what did we do here? We assigned the value 5 to a variable named r. That variable could have just about any name - the name isn’t really important - it’s just a place holder. Notice in our environment window that we have a new row that shows a variable named r with a value of 5. We can easily retrieve this value by typing the name of the variable in our console:\nr ## [1] 5 This means we can use it in place of a value anywhere in our code:\npi*r^2 ## [1] 78.53982 If we assigned a new value to r, the value would change:\nr\u0026lt;-10 pi*r^2 ## [1] 314.1593 Instead of returning a value from an operation to our console, we could also store that in a variable:\ncircle_area\u0026lt;-pi*r^2 And now we could retrieve that:\ncircle_area ## [1] 314.1593 This will become more intuitive the more you use R. Now’s a good time to start to internalize some conventions around variable naming.\n Variables are case sensitive, so variable and Variable are different things. Variables cannot start with numerals, they must start with a letter Variables cannot contain spaces. Convention is to use an underscore or period (e.g. variable_one or variable.one) if you want to denote spaces in a variable name. If you define a variable with the same name as an R constant (such as pi), your variable will supersede R’s value:  pi ## [1] 3.141593 pi\u0026lt;-2000 pi ## [1] 2000 You will start to develop your own naming conventions for variables as you learn R. Keeping variable names short and descriptive becomes important, particularly as you add objects to your workspace.\nAs we learn more about other R features, you’ll also want to avoid naming variables in ways that are similar to R functions. No need to worry about those details just yet, but keep this in mind as we move along.\nFinally, keep in mind that you can remove existing variables from your workspace using the rm() command. rm() will accept in the bracket the name of the object you’d like to remove (be careful is this is permanent):\nrm(pi) Even more finally, if you want to clear your entire workspace, you can do so as follows (remember that this is a permanent clearing):\nrm(list=ls())  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"436c88d459f5739722b21208c83291f8","permalink":"/howto/howto/04-basic_commands/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/howto/howto/04-basic_commands/","section":"howto","summary":"With those basics in mind, you can start to explore the basic functionality of R.\nStarting Simple - Math and Basic Operators Now that you have a basic lay of the land for the RStudio console, we can start to explore some logic and functionality.","tags":null,"title":"Your First Commands","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis. First, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing. Second, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output. Third, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"736ff88980c16b6e589aa3aa15e7610f","permalink":"/howto/howto/00-get_started/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/howto/howto/00-get_started/","section":"howto","summary":"R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines.

By default R Notebooks are quite verbose - you get a lot of output including many things that are useful for you when you are conducting analysis.

In this case, the workflow is built around conducting an independent analysis of the Protect Chicago Plus program that enhances SARS-CoV-19 Vaccination availability and outreach in communities in which uptake is low and infections and deaths are high.\nWe’ve examined maps that help to visualize the disparities in where COVID cases are and where vaccinations are more prevalent:\nAs of February 17, 2021, Chicago is reporting 95,321 people fully vaccinated: 3.4% of the population.\nWho is dying: Who is vaccinated: pic.twitter.com/LZt6OPYgiN\n\u0026mdash; ChiVaxBot (@ChiVaxBot) February 18, 2021  The initial goal of our analysis will be to verify that the City has designated those community areas for Protect Chicago Plus with high levels of need. From there, we will also explore some of the demographic correlates associated with these neighborhoods to think about further questions that may emerge.\nWhat we’re doing here is loosely a validation of existing policy targeting. From there we can think about how we might use questions that emerge from our validation for further exploration and explanation.\nGetting Set Up As usual, we’ll start by loading some packages.\nlibrary(ggplot2) library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✓ tibble 3.0.4 ✓ dplyr 1.0.2 ## ✓ tidyr 1.1.2 ✓ stringr 1.4.0 ## ✓ readr 1.4.0 ✓ forcats 0.5.0 ## ✓ purrr 0.3.4 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() library(RSocrata) We’ve spent time with ggplot2 and tidyverse prior but not RSocrata. RSocrata is an R interface for Socrata, which is a data platform designed to host public-facing open data (and which is used by many local governments).\nIn this case, we’ll use RSocrata to load data for City of Chicago’s datasets on COVID Cases and Deaths\ncdph\u0026lt;-RSocrata::read.socrata(\u0026quot;https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/yhhz-zm2v.json\u0026quot;)  Exploratory Plotting The data on COVID case positivity contain multiple observations for each ZIP code (one per week). We can use geom_path() to create line charts that chart the positivity rate over time:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), group = zip_code))+geom_path() ## Warning: Removed 187 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). Who - a little messy, but we can already see some general trends regarding case positivity. THere are two main “humps” where overall case rates go up, one in summer, and one in fall. At the same time, we can see that there’s some spread - some ZIP codes have much higher peaks and do not see rates return as low as others.\nThe primary question at this point is, do those ZIP codes with higher peaks and continued elevated rates correspond with the Protect Chicago Plus designation?\n Identify Protect Chicago Plus ZIP Codes Documentation from Protect Chicago Plus lists the specific Chicago community areas where enhanced outreach and vaccinations will take place. Here’s a Community Area map for reference with Protect Chicago Plus areas highlighted in blue:\nCommunity Areas are a Chicago-specific geography. The data we downloaded on case positivity is at the ZIP code level. How do we reconcile these two things? We could be fancy and use some spatial methods to find the overlap between the selcted community areas and zip codes, but let’s do this manually for now using visual inspection.\nHere’s a map from City of Chicago that overlays Community Areas and ZIP Codes.\nWe can start eyeballing which ZIP codes overlap which Community Areas. Here’s a rough list of the overlap:\n Austin - 60707, 60639, 60644, 60651 Archer Heights - 60632 Back of the Yards (New City) - 60609 Belmont Cragin - 60634, 60639, 60641 Chicago Lawn - 60629 Englewood - 60621 Gage Park - 60629, 60632 Humboldt Park - 60612, 60624, 60651 Little Village - 60608 North Lawndale - 60623 Montclare - 60707, 60634 Roseland - 60628 South Deering - 60617 Washington Heights - 60620, 60643 West Englewood - 60636  Our visual inspection leaves us with a list of the ZIP codes which are (roughly) targeted for Protect Chicago. There is not perfect correspondence, and some of the residents of the ZIP codes will not be targeted. However, the rough correspondence should help us understand some general patterns that allow us to compare case positivity between designated and undesignated ZIP codes.\nLet’s create a new categorical variable in our CDPH data called Targeted, and label those ZIP codes that are part of our list “Protect Chicago” and all other ZIP codes “Other ZIP Code”:\ncdph\u0026lt;-cdph %\u0026gt;% mutate(Targeted = case_when(zip_code %in% c( \u0026quot;60608\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60609\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60612\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60617\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60620\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60621\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60623\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60624\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60628\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60629\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60632\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60634\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60636\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60639\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60641\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60643\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60644\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60651\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60707\u0026quot;) ~ \u0026quot;Protect Chicago\u0026quot;, TRUE ~ \u0026quot;Other ZIP Code\u0026quot;)) case_when() is a useful tool for conditionally recoding values. Here we are telling it when a value in the zip_code column corresponds to the list of ZIP codes given, we’ll label those rows “Protect Chicago”. All other rows will be labelled “Other ZIP Code”. As a reminder, we use a mutate() statement to create a new variable.\nNow we can re-visit the previous plot, but this time, let’s color each of the zip codes by whether they are targeted under Protect Chicago or not:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+geom_path() ## Warning: Removed 4 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). It looks like there may be a pattern, but it can be a bit hard to see due to overplotting. Let’s change the alpha (transparency) on our plot geometry to see what’s going on under all those lines:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+geom_path(alpha=.2) ## Warning: Removed 4 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). And let’s also add a statistical summary line for each series. By default GGPlot uses a loess smoothed line:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+ geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; ## Warning: Removed 133 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). ## Warning: Removed 4 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). In the above code, I also removed the removed the error shading (se=FALSE) for visual simplicity.\nThis is looking pretty good - we can see some substantial differences in case positivity rates for Protect Chicago ZIP codes versus those that are not targeted. This gives us some confidence that the program’s targeting is appropriate.\nWe now have results that at face value make sense and help us to feel fairly confident that the program is targeting communities with the highest need. Given that, let’s invest in a clean up our plot by adding sensible labels and scale formats:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+ geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Case Rate (per 100,000)\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; ## Warning: Removed 133 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth). ## Warning: Removed 4 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path). At this point, we might also consider a plot that does not include the data series but which just visualizes the statistical summaries of the data:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(case_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Case Rate (per 100,000)\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; ## Warning: Removed 133 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).  COVID Deaths We have focused on plotting case positivity. In the past we’ve looked at COVID deaths as another important measure of need. Do the Protect Chicago Plus ZIP codes also have elevated rates of deaths per capita due to COVID? Let’s repeat the same plot for COVID deaths:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(death_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+ geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Death Rate (per 100,000)\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; And the plot of the statistical summaries:\ncdph %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=week_end, y=as.numeric(death_rate_weekly), colour = Targeted))+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Death Rate (per 100,000)\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; Much quicker now that we have a general plot format developed. We now have a good sense of one portion of the rationale for Protect Chicago Plus targeting - We know the program is targeting neighborhoods that tend to have elevated case positivity rates and death rates. But what about the vaccine situation in these same places?\n COVID Vaccination Data Let’s now load City of Chicago data on COVID Vaccination Rates\ncdph_vacc\u0026lt;-RSocrata::read.socrata(\u0026quot;https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/553k-3xzc.json\u0026quot;) Now that we’ve downloaded vaccination data, we can create the same Targeted variable in these data:\ncdph_vacc\u0026lt;-cdph_vacc %\u0026gt;% mutate(Targeted = case_when(zip_code %in% c( \u0026quot;60608\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60609\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60612\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60617\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60620\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60621\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60623\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60624\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60628\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60629\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60632\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60634\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60636\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60639\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60641\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60643\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60644\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60651\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60707\u0026quot;) ~ \u0026quot;Protect Chicago\u0026quot;, TRUE ~ \u0026quot;Other ZIP Code\u0026quot;)) Now that we’ve added the Targeted variable, let’s make an initial plot similar to our final plots for COVID cases and deaths\ncdph_vacc %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=date, y=as.numeric(vaccine_series_completed_percent_population), colour = Targeted))+ geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Vaccination Rate\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; Ok, probably some clean up or noise in the data - it looks like we’re probably missing data for some zip codes (the straight lines). We could remove, but let’s proceed for now.\nLet’s add a summary smoothed line as we’ve done before\ncdph_vacc %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=date, y=as.numeric(vaccine_series_completed_percent_population), colour = Targeted))+ geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Vaccination Rate\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; And let’s plot the summary without the data series:\ncdph_vacc %\u0026gt;% filter(population \u0026gt; 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=date, y=as.numeric(vaccine_series_completed_percent_population), colour = Targeted))+ #geom_path(alpha=.2)+ stat_smooth(se=FALSE)+ labs(x=\u0026quot;Date\u0026quot;, y=\u0026quot;COVID Vaccination Rate\u0026quot;, colour = \u0026quot;Type\u0026quot;)+ scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format())+ theme_classic() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;gam\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ s(x, bs = \u0026quot;cs\u0026quot;)\u0026#39; If we stop here, we could affirm that Protect Chicago seems to be targeting some of the most acutely impacted zip codes in the city, which is good, since that’s a major targeting principle of the policy!\n Neighborhood Demographics Let’s go a little further. Our list of targeted zip codes might lead us to be curious about the demographics of targeted and not targeted zip codes. I’ve downloaded some American Community Survey data which we can now load (downloading Census data is another tutorial):\nchi_zcta\u0026lt;-read_rds(\u0026quot;06_build_analysis/chi_zcta.rds\u0026quot;) We’ve loaded data on ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) which are the Census Bureau’s proxy for US Postal Service ZIP codes.\nLet’s add a new column with our Targeted designations:\nchi_zcta \u0026lt;-chi_zcta %\u0026gt;% mutate(Targeted = case_when(GEOID10 %in% c( \u0026quot;60608\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60609\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60612\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60617\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60620\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60621\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60623\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60624\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60628\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60629\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60632\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60634\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60636\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60639\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60641\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60643\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60644\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60651\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;60707\u0026quot;) ~ \u0026quot;Protect Chicago\u0026quot;, TRUE ~ \u0026quot;Other ZIP Code\u0026quot;)) For these data, we could start by plotting, but in this case, let’s produce a summary table. We take the data, group it by whether a ZIP code was targeted or not, and then produce a summary table with the average values for ZIP codes (summarise_at allows you to select the specific variables you wish to summarize and then applies the same summary function to all of them).\nLet’s start by summarizing a few race variables:\nchi_zcta %\u0026gt;% group_by(Targeted) %\u0026gt;% summarise_at(vars(PWhite:PForeignborn), mean, na.rm=TRUE) ## # A tibble: 2 x 8 ## Targeted PWhite PBlack PAIAN PAsian PNonwhite PLatino PForeignborn ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Other ZIP Code 0.602 0.210 0.00346 0.114 0.398 0.150 0.200 ## 2 Protect Chicago 0.321 0.484 0.00332 0.0250 0.679 0.346 0.177 Next up, a few income variables:\nchi_zcta %\u0026gt;% group_by(Targeted) %\u0026gt;% summarise_at(vars(Pov, PCI, MHHI, ServOccup, Commute), mean, na.rm=TRUE) ## # A tibble: 2 x 6 ## Targeted Pov PCI MHHI ServOccup Commute ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Other ZIP Code 0.157 55445. 78254. 0.153 0.144 ## 2 Protect Chicago 0.253 20524. 41210. 0.262 0.206 And finally, let’s summarize some housing characteristics:\nchi_zcta %\u0026gt;% group_by(Targeted) %\u0026gt;% summarise_at(vars(MHV, OCB, RCB, MGR), mean, na.rm=TRUE) ## # A tibble: 2 x 5 ## Targeted MHV OCB RCB MGR ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Other ZIP Code 337439. 0.284 0.417 1398. ## 2 Protect Chicago 181895. 0.367 0.545 935. Now might be a good time for some more exploratory plotting, starting with some selected univariate descriptions:\nExploratory Plots: Income chi_zcta %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=MHHI, fill = Targeted))+geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. chi_zcta %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=MHHI, colour = Targeted))+geom_boxplot()  Exploratory Plots: Poverty chi_zcta %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x=Pov, fill = Targeted))+geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

During the first two weeks of the class, you will develop your grading contact, which outlines the grade you are contracting for in the class as well as the agreed upon expectations for attaining that grade.\nThe grade you receive at the end of the class will be based on whether you did the work which you contracted for. Separately from this assessment, you will receive feedback on the qualities of your work.\n Please use the following contract template to construct your proposed learning contract for the semester.   A few guidelines for constructing your contract:\n For most of you, your learning contract will include the following baseline standard items in order to contract for a grade of “B”:  Class Interaction  Attend Class Regularly: Show up for course sessions before or on time, be absent from no more than three course sessions over the course of the semester. If you are unable to be present due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please let me know before the course session in which you are absent, and I will consider excusing the absent. Participate Actively: In addition to showing up to class sessions on time, you are expected to make thoughtful and informed contributions to our class community. This includes coming to class prepared and having completed readings, reflections and assignments. This also includes thoughtful engagement with course material, asking and responding to questions, and helping other students familiarize course concepts. Be Visible: Due to necessary COVID-19 safety precautions, most of our synchronous course sessions will be offered via Zoom. Active participation in the discussion portions of our course ask that you engage with your camera on. If there are reasons you cannot meet this expectation, you may propose omitting or modifying this component of your contract. Submit Work On Time: There will be three grade reconciliation periods in the semester. Each assignment will be due within a reconciliation period. Each assignment will also list a recommended due date. You are responsible for submitting your work by the end of the grade reconciliation period. Work due within a reconciliation period that is submitted within 48 hours of the conclusion of that period will be counted as late. Work due within a reconciliation period submitted more than 48 hours will be considered ignored.  Assignments  Class Reflections: On a weekly basis, you will reflect briefly on a few questions that guide our work in that week. R Learner’s Permit: You will complete the R Learner’s Permit notebook which tests your knowledge of basic R programming concepts. Lab Notebooks (3): Throughout the course you will work with lab notebooks that are designed to help you learn new analytical concepts, approaches, and datasets. You will select three of these notebooks to polish and submit for review. Term Project Proposal: You will develop a proposal for your term project, which asks you to perform an in-depth analysis around a theme of your choice. Your proposal will provide a broad overview rationale for your project, and will lay out details that will go into the project background and completed project. Term Project Background: Your project background documentation will build upon your term project proposal. You will provide a detailed exploration of data and analysis strategies for your term project, and will also start to sketch out key outputs and findings. Completed Project: You will produce a final project which will include a complete project rationale, background, and analysis. Project Presentation: Graduate students are required to prepare a 10-minute presentation on their project which they will give at the end of the semester. Undergraduates may elect to include a presentation as an extended component of their contract.  Contract Extensions and Deletions  You may propose contract extensions in order to contract for a higher grade. You may propose contract deletions in order to contract for a lower grade.    After you submit your proposed learning contract, we will schedule a 20-minute one-on-one meeting to discuss your goals and contract elements. After that meeting (and after any agreed upon revisions are made), we will sign your contract and you will be held to contracted standards. You will have one opportunity to revisit the terms of your contract around the middle of the semester.\nSubmission Instructions Upload your grading contract to the appropriate folder in your class GitHub repository.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"562cd6d81e05bba4fb8e592b8747ea5d","permalink":"/assignments/assignments/01_grading_contract/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/assignments/01_grading_contract/","section":"assignments","summary":"Due Date: February 5, 2021 | Submit Via: Upload to Github\nOur course syllabus outlines the approach to contract grading that we’ll be using this semester.

Visit https://cloud.r-project.org which will automatically direct you to the best download server.\nOnce here, you can then download and install R using the version that matches your operating system:\nGo ahead and download R and install following the installer defaults. After R is downloaded and installed, run R to confirm. You should see a single window that looks something like this:\nThat’s it for R. This should be the first and last time you’ll need to open the R console directly. We typically will not access R directly, but instead will use RStudio as our primary interface. Go ahead and close the R console and proceed by downloading and installing RStudio, which is the IDE we will use to interface and write code with R.\n Downlad RStudio Next up, let’s download RStudio. Go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download. Click on “Download” under RStudio Desktop. The website will suggest the most appropriate current version of the software based upon the computer you are loading RStudio on. You may also choose from an alternate installer if you believe it is more appropriate for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio, again using the default installation settings.\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open RStudio. You should see something that looks like this (the information in your console window will likely describe a newer version of R than what is displayed here).\nYou’ll note that what appears in the portion of the console to the left looks very similar to the R console window which you opened before you started your install of RStudio. This console functions in exactly the same way, however, you’ll also note that there are other areas which you have access to as well.\n## Rtools error (PC users)\nSome PC users may encounter an error message regarding Rtools not being installed. This would come up with you first try to install a package such as tidyverse either using R’s package manager or using the install.packages() command. To remedy this error if it occurs, PC users need to close R, manually download a patch, install it, and restart your computer. This error should then be remedied.\nIf you are a PC user who encounters this error, please do the following: 1. Save any work and close your RStudio session 2. Download Rtools (download link) + the link above contains instructions for putting Rtools on the PATH - you should not need to do this. 3. Run the downloaded executable file to install Rtools 4. Restart your computer 5. Re-open RStudio - the problem should be resolved\n The RStudio Interface  The R Console is the place where code you write is executed. Typically we’ll write code in a script or R Notebook (more on those later) and active pieces of code will them be executed in the R console. You can also type code directly into the console and execute it by hitting the return or enter key. The Environment Window provides information on variables, data tables, and other objects you create and define as you work. The Auxiliary Window provides a range of information, and includes a file browser, plot visualization window, and access to help documentation.

It’s my assumption that you have likely not worked with these data before - that’s part of the point!\nThe PLUTO data contains information on each tax lot within the city of New York.

(Preface and Chapter 2)\nData Carpentry (Before We Start, Intro to R, Starting with Data)\n Slides  Other Resources This lab will serve as your initial introduction to the R programming language and RStudio development environment. There are two lab notebooks for this week - today’s, which introduces a few general principles of the R programming language and interface, and one for Session 4 which introduces more advanced data manipulation tools contained in the dplyr package. We will adjust the speed at which we work based upon your feedback and how things go this week. After that, most labs will be introduced on Tuesdays and we will continue working in the same lab notebook on Thursday.\nLab Download Please download the lab files. Once downloaded and decompressed, click on the “Session 3 Lab.Rproj” file. R will open, but nothing will (seem to) happen. In the R file browser (lower right quadrant), open the “Session 3 Workbook Blank.Rmd” file. You can start following the instructions contained within the file. (To make things easier to read, you may want to hit the \"Knit: button, which will produce an html file you can open in any browser.) When you’re done, have a look at the “Session 3 Workbook Solutions.Rmd” file, which shows you my answers to the work in this lab. Note - I encourage you to take a look when you need to, but there is NO good reason to rush to answers as opposed to learning through doing and thinking through the problems you are presented with.   Lab Goals By the end of this lab, you should be familiar with:\n The RStudio console and R language R data types and structures Basic data manipulation and querying   Lab Description For new users, R can be an intimidating programming language to learn, especially compared to other popular data analysis tools:\n   Learning Curves for Popular Data Analysis Tools, Leah A. Wasser \nAt the same time, there are some really good reasons to gain familiarity with R and RStudio, particularly within the context of urban planning analysis.\n R and RStudio are open source tools, and are therefore available to be downloaded and used without cost (this does not negate questions regarding accessibility of the language, given its steep learning curve) R and RStudio are supported by a wide range of users who develop packages for specific use cases, including those that are useful for urban planning analysis (we will spend more time learning about packages later in this lab) R and RStudio provide a framework for reproducible data manipulation and analysis - rather than sharing output with others, we can share raw data and code and they can reproduce our output Principles of reproducible analysis make it easy to modify previous code for new data or use cases  Thinking about the type of analysis we will do in this class, there are some additional rationales for learning and working in R and RStudio:\n R has a powerful set of functions for aggregating and manipulating many data records into a smaller number of summary records - we use these types of functions frequently to summarize neighborhood characteristics R can natively read from and write to many types of data sources - this allows us to perform most or all of our analysis within a single applcation rather than passing data between applications for different types of manipulation or analysis R can help us to automate elements of data visualization, which can be useful when we need to reproduce forms of analysis for different places or other data categories Looking beyond the reasons to use R and RStudio as a platform for analysis, these tools represent one of several programming languages frequently used for data science (the other main language being Python) - learning these langugages prepares you for future interface with other data science tools and strategies  With the basic rationale laid out, let’s start exploring the logic behind the R language.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b3adacd42c9a51e24adadd3c568f0e7d","permalink":"/schedule/session/03-starting_with_data/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/session/03-starting_with_data/","section":"schedule","summary":"Session Description In this session, we’ll take our first foray into the R and RStudio ecosystem.

As you will hear many times in class, almost every problem you encounter in R, someone else has also encountered. A few tips:\nStart with R’s internal help. in your console, you can search for documentation for a given command by prefacing it with a question mark (e.g. ?mean). You can also type help() to access general help in R.\n Next, turn to the internet. You might start with R Documentation or Stack Overflow.\n Get help from our class community. A big portion of our time together in class will be devoted to learning from each other - part of that includes learning to troubleshoot problems. We’ll devote some synchronous time in class to working through challenges, and will supplement that with asynchronous means of communication via our course Slack channel. Ask questions early and often - there’s no need to unduly suffer through setbacks (although as you solve these you will learn deeply how to address similar problems in the future).\n  Whenever I get discouraged and want to quit something, I remember the words of my then 3 year-old after she puked carrots all over the living room floor: \u0026quot;I\u0026#39;m gonna need more carrots.\u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 18, 2021  While not set up as a support resource, there are other websites that may help you to extend your capacity in R.\n Some of the initial tutorials we’ll use to learn R come from Data Carpentry, especially their series on R for Social Scientists and Introduction to R for Geospatial Data. The swirl package is designed to teach you the basics of R in R. Check out other useful tutorials available at r4ds, STHDA.com, and R Bloggers. A “classic” framing document for new learners of R is The R Inferno. Another important framing document is Keiran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science.

Early on in the class, you’ll manually push files to your GitHub repository. As we move forward in class, you’ll learn how GitHub is integrated with R, and you can learn how to use R to interact directly with GitHub.\nGitHub offers some services for free, however, as a student at an educational institution, you can register via GitHub for Education to recieve enhanced benefits and services.\nLet’s get this set up:\nIf you do not already have a GitHub account, go to GitHub.com and then click on Sign Up to create a new account. You will make a username (see some sage username advice here), enter your email address, and password, and then hit create account. I recommend using your UIUC email address for this step if you’re creating a new account (for my rationale, see the next step). GitHub offers some services for free which you can access with your basic account, however, as a student at an educational institution, you can register with GitHub Education to receive enhanced benefits and services. You will be asked to verify your association with an academic institution, which you can do by entering your [netid]@illinois.edu email address and taking a picture of your I-Card.

Within the repository, you’ll see a readme file that you can modify to track your work as you upload it. You’ll also see folders into which you can upload your assignments. To use the template to create your own assignment repository, click on the green button that says Use This Template. On the next screen choose a name for this repository (you can name it whatever you like). You can choose to make the repository public or private. Public repositories can be seen by anyone. Private repositories can only be seen by those you give permission to (if you make your repository private, you will have to grant me permission to be able to view it for the purposes or grading).

That strategy also overlooks most of the features of what GitHub is at its core - a version control system.\nWe might want to version our work for several reasons:\n To keep track of changes we’ve made, so that we can track when code works and when we’ve broken it To be able to share code with collaborators and work on the same files at the same time and then reconcile and combine work all together To be able to share code and data publicly with others  All three of these rationales are important motivations within the context of our class. There are two strategies which you may want to try to integrate GitHub into your R workflow.\nUsing the GitHub Desktop Client GitHub Desktop is an application that allows you to upload, download, and reconcile github repositories stored on your computer with your GitHub account. From GitHub desktop, you can create new repositories, download previously created repositories, and upload new versions of repository contents to the cloud.\n Using RStudio’s integrated Github Functionality RStudio has GitHub functionality built right in, which is very handy for integrating version control into your R workflow. Getting RStudio set up to work with GitHub can be a bit tedious, but once it is set up, it is straightforward to use. An outstanding resource to help you get GitHub integrated with R is Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. As the authors mention in a section titled appropriately Is It Going to Hurt?, integrating Git changes your workflow. However, since many of you are just starting to learn R, making this part of your typical workflow early on will be challenging, but less of a change from other ways of doing things.\nAssuming you’ve already got R and RStudio installed on your system and have already set up a GitHub account, you can start here:\nCheck to see if Git is installed on your computer, and if it isnt, Install Git. Associate git on your computer with your GitHub account. Install a Git client like GitHub Desktop. Connect to GitHub Connect RStudio to GitHub Get Started using GitHub integrated with R (we’ll talk more about this in class).  We will ease our way into using Git, and will also devote some time to troubleshooting in class.

Your term assignment will have several deliverables which are spread throughout the semester:\nProject Proposal Due Date: March 5, 2021 | Submit Via: Upload to Github\nAssignment You will develop a proposal that describes the analysis which you contract to complete by the end of the semester. Your proposal will include a statement regarding the motivation for your analysis, the information you plan to use, your analytical strategy, your anticipated outcomes, and information on the format of your final outputs.\nBy the end of this assignment you will:\nArticulate a question or problem which you will analyze over the course of the term project Describe the context within which the question exists Propose a strategy for how you will approach the problem - including the data you will use, the methods by which you will analyze that information, and the outputs which you will produce Identify how the answers to this question are relevant for general knowledge, policy, or decision-making   Deliverable Please prepare a 3-4 page (single-spaced) proposal. Your proposal should address the following:\nOutline the question or problem which your analysis will examine. You should provide a clear and succinct description of the question or problem, and also discuss its relevance - who will the answer to this question be relevant to? How might your analysis guide their actions? Describe the context within which the question or problem exists in such a way that it is clear why answering this question is of value. What’s the geographic location and scale you are examining? Why is this question of importance here? Who is impacted by the phenomena you seek to explore? What do we already know, and what information is missing? How will you engage both the known and the unknown through exploration of your question? Propose a strategy for how you will approach the problem that is clear, connected to the question and context, and that is appropriate for the information you plan to use. What specific data source(s) will you use for your analysis? What methods will you use to engage your question? What’s the precedent for using these methods to answer similar questions? Why is this an appropriate approach given your answers to (1) and (2) above? Identify the target audience for your work by telling us who has a stake in learning from your answers to the questions you pose. What contribution will this make, and how might it be useful for advocacy, deliberation, and decision-making? Identify any limitations or assistance you will need to successfully complete your analysis. You may not yet completely know the answer to this, but please spend some time thinking about how I (and we as a class) can help to support you in your work, or can help you identify ways to access those resources that will help. If you can, also articulate the limitations of your work - your answers will likely have some important limitations that we should have in mind, even before you jump into your actual analysis.   Tips for a Successful Assignment  Your proposal should be 3-4 single-spaced pages in length. Write clearly and succinctly, paying attention to spelling, grammar, and the organization of information. Provide a clear and logical structure to your proposal, using descriptive section titles to organize information. The judicious use of maps, photographs, charts, tables, and diagrams should be considered as a valuable means of effectively conveying information. These do not count against your proposal page limit.    Project Background Due Date: March 26, 2021 (Extended to April 2, 2021) | Submit Via: Upload to Github\nThe project background deliverable is designed to get you working independently on your final project. For this deliverable, you should be able to share an early version of your analysis. To meet the expectations for this deliverable, you should have identified the data sources you plan to work with, identified the methods you are using the analyze the data, and you should have implemented some aspects of your analysis. It is expected that your analysis will not yet be complete, but that you will be far enough along that you can articulate a pathway and future steps towards your final analysis and deliverable at the end of the semester.\nYour project background should include the following:\n Context and Background: Provide a brief update on context and background for your analysis. This should be high-level and just enough information to provide context for the remaining portions of your project background. Methods and Approach: Describe your approach to analysis - how are you analyzing the data? What precedents or work that others have done is helping to inform your approach? Data Sources: Describe the data source(s) that you are using for your analysis. Where are these data coming from? What are each contributing? What are the specific indicators you are using from these data? Data Description, Preliminary Analysis and Interpretation: Please share the preliminary analysis which you’ve done with the data, as well as your written interpretation based upon your analysis. Directions for the Future: Provide a summary of how you plan to expand upon your preliminary analysis moving forward to your final project.  Please submit your project background document as a R Notebook with all accompanying files necessary to knit it.\n Final Project Due Date: May 7, 2021 | Submit Via: Upload to Github\nBuilding upon your project proposal and project background, you will produce a final project which includes your analysis and interpretation.\nPlease upload your final project as a R Notebook (or other format as specified in your learning contract) and all files necessary to replicate it to GitHub.\n Project Presentation Due Date: April 25, 2021 | Submit Via: Upload to Github\nGraduate students are required to include a 10-minute presentation on their final project which will be given during one of our final course sessions as part of their grading contract.

What forms of analysis do you see as being useful to your own work? What types of analytic approaches do you see as being useful to your own work?   Before Class Hopkins Chapter 1 and Chapter 4\nLynch, Kevin (1960). The Image of the City. Chapter 3\nDenver Far Northeast Area Plan\nE. 38th Street Urban Design Assessment\n Slides  Other Resources Activity Prompt Early in the class, we spent time talking about some ways to describe the essential characteristics of neighborhoods. We now also have some foundational data manipulation skills in hand. It’s time to start thinking about how we might bring together our conceptual understanding of neighborhoods with some of our increased knowledge about data and types of description.\nFor today’s class session, you also read a diverse range of materials designed to help you think through some of the different ways we use information to tell stories about neighborhoods and within planning more generally.\nLet’s try to bring these things together in a collaborative exercise.\nAs you’ll recall, last week, we took a look at a series of maps for Chicago zip codes that described who is dying from SARS-CoV19 and who is vaccinated:\nAs of February 15, 2021, Chicago is reporting 91,999 people fully vaccinated: 3.3% of the population.\nWho is dying: Who is vaccinated: pic.twitter.com/fEM00ZSZir\n\u0026mdash; ChiVaxBot (@ChiVaxBot) February 16, 2021  As this information circulates amongst groups throughout the city and region, many groups seek to respond and to produce information that will help their constituents.\nYou will divide into four groups (breakout rooms) who have a vested interest in understanding better the implications of SARS-CoV-19 vaccinations and death rates for their constituents:\nAustin Neighbors United - a (fictitious) Neighborhood Group in Chicago’s Austin neighborhood focused on improving the quality of life for local residents:\nCity of Chicago - a task force assembled by the Mayor to focus on neighborhood health and wellbeing during the SARS-CoV19 Pandemic.\nChicago Council of Small Business Owners - a (fictitious) advocacy group focused on the needs of home-based businesses and businesses with fewer than 20 employees throughout the city.\nMetropolitan Planning Council - an independent regional organization focused on shaping a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous Chicago region through research and policy development.\nWorking together, prepare a short (5 minute) presentation that engages with the following prompts:\nInterest: Articulate why your organization or group is interested in the relationship between COVID deaths and vaccinations. Aside from there being potential major equity issues (as we’ve talked about in the past), why specifically would your constituents be concerned? How would this influence the work of your organization?\n Questions: Articulate 2 to 4 specific questions which build upon your knowledge of what these maps show and that help to engage your organization’s interest.\n Scale: What is the geographic and temporal scale at which these questions need to be answered? What are the trade-offs involved with engaging at this scale versus alternatives?\n Key Measures: Describe 2-3 key measures which will be important for your work. Research where the information will come from that constitutes these measures, their availability at the scale you wish to work at, and identify tradeoffs between these measures and alternatives. What’s the precedent for the use of these measures?\n Key Analyses: Describe 2-3 key analyses which you will perform in order to engage with the questions you have identified.\n Visual Outputs: Describe at least one visual output associated with each of your analyses. If you have time, prepare a rough sketch of what each output might look like conceptually, and prepare to share it.\n Overall Outputs and Communications Plan: How will you share the information from your analyses with your constituents? How do you anticipate they will make use of it? How will you ensure that it is accessible and reproducible for others?\n  As a group, spend around 30 minute thinking through these aspects of your analysis. We will then return to plenary, and each group will spend 5 minutes presenting and will also have 5 minutes for discussion and conversation.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"831e701991286b58022099992cf41566","permalink":"/schedule/session/07-modes_of_analysis/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/session/07-modes_of_analysis/","section":"schedule","summary":"Session Description In this session, we’ll take a step back from the nuts and bolts of our R training and will examine modes of neighborhood analysis.\n This Week’s Reflection Prompt  What types of questions do you have about the structure and function of neighborhoods?","tags":null,"title":"Session 7: Modes of Neighborhood Analysis","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Here are some ideas for contract extensions you may wish to propose (you can of course develop and propose other ideas as well):\n Develop a Neighborhood Analysis Portfolio: You could contract to create a portfolio of your analysis work over the course of the semester. This portfolio would include polished output suitable to share with a prospective employer or internship site.\n Extend a Lab Notebook: Over the course of the semester, you’ll be working through several lab notebooks that walk you through techniques and approaches to different modes of neighborhood analysis. You could propose extending the analysis you are asked to do in these notebooks beyond what is asked of you in the lab. This might include a more expanded analysis of the data, or the application of the lab concepts to a different context or data of your choosing. Extending a lab notebook should involve producing some type of formalized output that is polished and ready for review.\n Write an Op Ed: Your final project asks you to perform a neighborhood-level analysis of your own design that is policy-relevant to a particular place. Based upon what your analysis reveals, you may have policy-relevant conclusions that it would be useful to share with a public audience. You can write an OpEd targeting a local newspaper that articulates a persuasive public argument and that draws substantively from your analysis. Good resources for this include The OpEd Project, the New York Times, Goh and Bourne, and Scientific American.\n Develop a proposed extension to your final project: It is likely that your final project will produce some insightful information drawing upon your analysis of existing data. It is also likely that through the process of conducting your analysis that you will reach the limits of what the data can tell you, and that you will have additional questions which you would like to answer. You can develop a proposed set of next steps based upon what you would do to continue to develop the analysis which you have conducted. This might include gaining insight from other sources of secondary data, applying other types of analytical techniques, or developing a plan for primary data collection to supplement your existing analysis.\n  These are a few suggested ways in which you can contract to extend your grade. You may have other ideas which you would like to propose. Please spend some time early in the class thinking about what your goals are this semester, and what work (in addition to our base expectations) might be part of this. Please be prepared to share these ideas when we meet one-on-one early in the semester to review your contract proposal. Of course we can also talk through some of these ideas in our class sessions during the first few weeks of class. As part of your contract proposal you will need to write a description of each extended contract component.

What are the implications of shifting towards a conversation focused on the public impact and cost of incarceration versus one focused on where offenses occur? In general, neighborhood crime data can be tricky to accurately represent - why might this be the case? What questions do we need to ask about crime reporting in order to effectively analyze and facilitate deliberation using data on were crimes occur?

Are there different considerations for how we tell stories? What is the burden of proof for neighborhood level analyses of two disparate kinds of information (for instance, covid infection rates and eviction rates)? What do we need to show to establish validity of our argument or mixing of data? How might we validate our analysis with “on the ground” examples? How do we communicate effectively with non-technical audiences about near real time relationships in our data? What are some effective narrative vehicles or ways of storytelling that connect people to abstract concepts or information?   Before Class Cunningham, Mary, Ananya Hariharan, and Olivia Fiol. 2021.

While our focus will be on analyzing current conditions, we will also learn how to tell stories about neighborhood change, and will learn how to project and forecast future trends. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will think about how our analysis of quantitative data fit with other forms of data and engagement to fill in gaps in knowledge.\nBy the end of this course, we will:\nBecome familiar with common sources of information used to describe neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics; Learn how to use R, RStudio, and Github to create reproducible analysis of neighborhood-level information; Learn how to use the information to tell compelling stories for deliberation and decision-making;   Course Format and Expectations We will learn together using a combination of direct instruction, lab sessions, and tutorials. We will use reading and reflection to help us contextualize our understanding of neighborhoods, however, our focus will be on learning by doing. Our class will typically meet in person twice per week - tuesdays will typically be devoted to introducing new information and to having discussion, and thursdays will typically be devoted to labs and collaborative work.\nPlease plan on bringing to class a computer that will run R and RStudio (available for PC/Mac/Linux) and for which you have administrative privileges.\nWhat to Expect from Me  Office Hours and Availability: I am generally accessible 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, however I have research and administrative commitments in addition to teaching and advising during the work week.Please make an appointment to speak one-on-one using my Calendly page link for our class. Communicating: The easiest way to communicate with me outside of class is via email. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time elapses, it is okay to nudge me to respond. Troubleshooting: You should feel welcome to use email and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting errors as they occur. I also encourage you to work with others in the class to troubleshoot problems - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and this also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.   What I Expect from You  Be Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community. Actively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on individual leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. Read with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. As you will soon learn, details matter in this class. Be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus). Act with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places a lot of trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work. Seek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means finding time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health. This also means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course.   Prerequisites UP 494-AG: Neighborhood Analysis has no prerequisites aside from upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level standing.\n Students will benefit from some prior knowledge of urban planning concepts, and analytic techniques, although these can be learned along the way. Students will also benefit from some prior knowledge working in R and RStudio, however, this is also not a course prerequisite. The first few weeks of our class incorporate an accelerated schedule for learning R and RStudio to support your deeper learning of neighborhood analysis. Please plan your time accordingly.  Please talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you.\n  Assignments You will find detailed information on assignments in the Assignments section.\n    Assignment Due Date Description    Grading Contract February 5, 2021 You will propose an individual grading contract by which you will be assessed this semester.  R Learner’s Permit February 19, 2021 You will demonstrate a basic understanding of the R programming language by completing the description of a dataset.  Class Reflections Ongoing On a weekly basis, you will reflect upon questions related to our class and your work.  Polished Lab Notebooks March 19, 2021 April 21, 2021 We will introduce new course material and analysis strategies via a series of lab notebooks. You will extend the work you have done in two of these notebooks and submit them for assessment.  Final Project Proposal March 5, 2021 As part of your final project, you will submit an initial proposal regarding the topic, scope, and strategy for your final analysis.  Final Project Background March 26, 2021 As part of your final project, you will submit project background that helps to describe your final analysis.  Final Project Presentation April 25, 2021 As part of your final project graduate students will present their final projects in a 10-15 minute presentation. Undergraduate students may include a final project presentation as part of their contract.  Final Project May 7, 2021 You will complete an independent policy analysis on a topic of your choice and will submit it along with a repository containing your code and supporting materials.     Evaluation and Grading Contract Alongside our learning of techniques and perspectives on working with small area data, a primary goal of this class is to learn to think critically about the ways in which those data and our analysis embody power and exist within power relationships. One implicit goal of our learning this semester is to embody through our work alternative ways to share power and create meaning. We will share power and authority for the evaluation of learning by establishing individualized grading contracts which will allow you to set many of the terms upon which your work is evaluated this semester. You will be held accountable to the standards you propose and we agree upon.\nWe are using this approach for several reasons:\nImplementing a contract-based assessment approach mirrors course goals regarding our understanding and practice around the power of data, particularly with regards to public deliberation, decision-making, and governance. Dealing differently with power around evaluation in our classroom mirrors how we might deal with power and power relationships in professional practice. A unitary assessment of performance in a 400-level class is not likely to serve students well. This class is open to advanced undergraduate students, masters students, and doctoral students - some who are pursuing degrees in planning and others who are not. Contracts will allow us to assess your work against your own goals and expectations. There is increasing evidence in higher education settings that unitary grading measures tend to hamper individual learning, and have the potential to be biased towards certain types of students. Put simply, obsessing about grades in advanced coursework is counter-productive to deep learning. This course adheres to the pedagogy that when given more control and ownership over the terms of evaluation, a student is more likely to embrace the challenges presented to them within the classroom, and are more likely to take ownership of their work (see, for instance Elbow and Inoue). We are attempting to learn together through a set of extremely challenging times. The impact of COVID-19 on your lives and your learning should not be discounted. The impact is also very individualized to each of your situations. A unitary grading standard would typically be strained to account for your circumstances.  Baseline Standards Each of you is expected to meet the following baseline standards. By doing so, you will earn a grade of “B”.\n Attend class regularly: Show up for course sessions before or on time, be absent from no more than three course sessions over the course of the semester. If you are unable to be present due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please let me know before the course session in which you are absent, and I will consider excusing the absent.\n Participate actively: In addition to showing up to class sessions on time, you are expected to make thoughtful and informed contributions to our class community. This includes coming to class prepared and having completed readings, reflections and assignments. This also includes thoughtful engagement with course material, asking and responding to questions, and helping other students learn course concepts. Submit work on time: Your assignments have due dates. You are responsible for submitting your work by this date. Work submitted within 48 hours of the due date will be counted as late. Work submitted more than 48 hours after the due date will be considered ignored.   Expectation Summary The baseline contract standard in the class is a “B”. You may customize your grading contract to contract for a grade between A and C (C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A). The below table will help you to propose accountability expectations:\n   Grade Absences Late Missed Ignored    A 3 1 0 0  B 3 1 0 0  C 4 2 1 1  D 5 3 2 1  F 6 4 3 1     Absences indicate the number of times you are absent from class. Additional excused absences may be allowed due to documented extenuating circumstances. Late Assignments are assignments submitted after a due date but within 48 hours of the due date. Missed Assignments are assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date. Ignored Assignments are assignments that are not submitted by the last day of class (excluding your final assignment). Ignored assignments are a more serious breach of contract than missed assignments as they reflect contracted work which you have not completed.  Please note that assessment of these contracted standards are based upon what you do. The default contracted “B” grade does not include any direct assessment of the quality of your work. As you design your personalized learning contract, you can use the above table to help you propose expectations in line with the final grade you wish to contract to receive.\n Preparing your Contract Our grading system this semester focuses on capturing the consistent application of your labor towards our course goals. If you consistently submit your work as contracted, you’ll receive a “B” at the end of the semester. Consequently, to contract for a higher (or lower) grade, you may commit yourself to applying more (or less) labor in support of course goals when you design your contract.\n Please use the following contract template to construct your proposed learning contract for the semester.     Honor Code The Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of the student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this course, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss assignments with your peers, all of your analysis, and writing should be your own. The consequence for violating these expectations may include receiving no credit for the assignment in question, and may include automatic failure of the course.\n Put simply, don’t cheat and give credit where credit is due.    Learning Environment and Support Learning Environment: The Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular opportunities. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\nCounseling Center and Student Support: Throughout the semester, you may need assistance coping with emotional, interpersonal, or academic concerns. The Counseling Center provides both short-term and longer-term counseling to students who may need assistance. Please do not hesitate to reach out or request assistance.\n Your Wellness Learning R and your Wellness Whether you have prior experience working in R or not, you will face challenges related to working with the software this semester. That’s a given, and is an expected part of learning in this class. Part of the goal is to teach you how to understand the intentionality behind the software so that you can anticipate where errors are likely to occur.\n The only way to do this, is to encounter errors - and there will be many!   You are learning a new language, it’s grammar, and its application. While this will be frustrating at times, there is a major payoff in the capacity you will gain in analytic skills and problem-solving. This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.\n   Image by Allison Horst \nYou are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting on sites like Stack Overflow and RStudio Community. Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before.\n When I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.   You got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I promise!\n Covid and your Wellness We’ve been living in particularly abnormal times for the last year and a half - while for many, things are improving substantially, it would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur “normally” even at this stage of recovery. We continue to teach and learn under emergency circumstances amidst a global pandemic.\nAs you face challenges this semester (and beyond) I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Overview and Objectives Course Format and Expectations  What to Expect from Me What I Expect from You Prerequisites  Assignments Evaluation and Grading Contract  Baseline Standards Expectation Summary Preparing your Contract  Honor Code Learning Environment and Support Your Wellness  Learning R and your Wellness Covid and your Wellness    Course Overview and Objectives This course teaches techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood and local government scale.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
