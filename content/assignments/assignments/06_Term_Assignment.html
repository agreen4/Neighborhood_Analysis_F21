<p>You will independently apply the skills and principles of data analysis we learn to produce a policy-relevant analysis. You should be drawing heavily from the prior memorandums which you have produced over the course of the semester. You may include new or more refined work, but most of the pieces should already exist within your previous work. Your goal should be to combine elements of this previous work into a publication ready policy report for your place. At a minimum, you should plan to structure your report to address the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context and Background:</strong> Drawing upon secondary sources, craft a narrative context and background for your analysis. This may include in-depth profiling of the neighborhood(s) of interest or may involve broader contextualizing drawing from the history and background of your place. Your narrative does not have to be long, but it should help to contextualize the questions you are engaging with and the methods you use to engage those questions.</li>
<li><strong>Methods and Approach:</strong> Describe your approach to analysis - what is the specific question or problem you are taking on? What precedents or work that others have done is helping to inform your approach? Why is the selected geographic scale of your analysis appropriate?</li>
<li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Describe the data source(s) that you are using for your analysis. Where are these data coming from? What are each contributing? What are the specific indicators you are using from these data?</li>
<li><strong>Data Description, Analysis and Interpretation:</strong> Please describe the analysis which you’ve done with the data, as well as your written interpretation based upon your analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Implications for Policy and Impact:</strong> Share your thoughts on how your findings can or should influence policy or otherwise have an impact within your place. You may also wish to provide some thoughts on how you or others may expand upon this work in the future or describe a set of future questions or analyses that build upon what you’ve done.</li>
</ul>
