## This Week's Reflection Prompt

- What types of characteristics might be well-represented within Census data? What characteristics are harder to measure or represent?

- As we've discussed in class, the census is a dynamic and evolving survey, and the questions we ask are a valuable window into the social questions and issues at a given time. What questions do you think we should be asking in this current moment? How well are they reflected in the census (as you know it)?
