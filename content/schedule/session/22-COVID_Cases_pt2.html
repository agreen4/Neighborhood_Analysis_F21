<h2>Session Description</h2>
<p>We will be taking a pause today.</p>
<p>Our zoom class session is cancelled. Instead of working on your lab, use the 80 minutes to go for a walk, take a nap, listen to music, go see the blossoming cherry trees, or call a friend. I am going to adjust the planned lab for tomorrow to refocus some of the content so that you can be prepared for our session next week.</p>
<p>I will send further information so that you can be prepared for next Thursdayâ€™s session shortly. Please let me know if you have any questions about this adjustment. Please also keep those R and class questions coming on Slack.</p>
