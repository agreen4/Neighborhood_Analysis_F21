<h2>This Week’s Reflection Prompt</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>What types of characteristics might be well-represented within Census data? What characteristics are harder to measure or represent?</p></li>
<li><p>As we’ve discussed in class, the census is a dynamic and evolving survey, and the questions we ask are a valuable window into the social questions and issues at a given time. What questions do you think we should be asking in this current moment? How well are they reflected in the census (as you know it)?</p></li>
