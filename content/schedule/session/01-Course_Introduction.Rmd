## Session Description

Welcome to Neighborhood Analysis! 

In our first course session, we will introduce ourselves and discuss how we will learn together this semester. We'll also think through two foundational questions:

1. What's a neighborhood?
2. Why do neighborhoods matter?

## This Week's Reflection Prompt

- What is a neighborhood? How should neighborhoods be defined? Why might neighborhoods be important units of analysis for city planners and urbanists?
- What characteristics make a neighborhood great?

## Before Class
